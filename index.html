    <h2>Who provides the Wifi</h2>
    <p>In this section we will analyse who provides free wifi in New York City. Data shows that Link Nyc is the main provider of wifi in Manhattan. Even though Spectrum makes an effort to also provide wifi, the New York City public initiative clearly leads the way. New York successfully achieved the conversion of 20th century payphone into modern public wifi. It is also interesting to note the important effort done by public transport, specially the subway, to provide this 21st century public service</p>
